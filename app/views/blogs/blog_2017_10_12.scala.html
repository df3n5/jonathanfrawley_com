# Scala Overmatching
## When matching is a bad fit
### 2017-10-12
Pattern matching in Scala is a very powerful technique when used correctly. Today, I would like to talk about some particularly strange usages of it that I have come across recently. I will talk about a few different anti-patterns I have seen and how they can be avoided.

## Defaulting
The first kind is when someone uses a match expression when a `.getOrElse` would suffice. Here is an example snippet:


    val DefaultName = "EMPTY"
    ...
    val maybeName: Option[String] = fetchName()
    val name = maybeName match {
      case Some(name) => name
      case None => DefaultName
    }

As you can see, there are 4 lines of code to tell `name` to be `maybeName` if it is defined and a default value otherwise. This happens to be the exact semantics captured by the `.getOrElse` method of the `Option` type. With this in mind, we can improve our code:


    val DefaultName = "EMPTY"
    ...
    val name: String = fetchName().getOrElse(DefaultName)

This eliminates 4 lines of code and in my opinion is simpler for the reader to understand what is happening.

## Boolean
Match expressions are fantastic, but sometimes they are overkill. Let's look at the following example:

    val isCached = ...
    isCached match {
      case true => "yes"
      case false => "no"
    }

It is much more straightforward to just use an if statement:

    val isCached = ...
    if (isCached) "yes"
    else "no"

Usually this comes down to a judgement call. I think for booleans, however, if statements are better.

## Matching too coarsely
One aspect that makes match expressions powerful is that they allow the programmer to document what values or types are acceptable and which are not.
Sometimes when programmers have a specific case that they want to catch, they leave the default case without a type:

    val enumVal = ...
    enumVal match {
      case MyEnumType1() => ...
      case _ => ...
    }

Sometimes this is what you want and sometimes it is not.
I would wager that if you are using enums and scala, it would be valuable to get a compiler error when you add a new type to this enum. This allows you to check to see if there is a specific case you need to handle for this new type in the flow.
If you use a match expression like the above, you are eliminating this advantage that Scala's type system is providing you.

This is also an anti-pattern when handling errors as this will mean the error does not bubble up correctly.

    val future = ...
    future.recover {
      case ExpectedException() =>
        println("Oh no, my expected exception occurred!")
    }

If for example an exception you were not expecting like the `SpanishInquisitionException`, then it would not be handled by this recover and the failure would bubble up and hopefully get handled gracefully.
If the programmer wishes to handle coarse errors then they can, but using a catch all means you will catch even fatal errors which should be handled only by the JVM. //TODO: CITATION NEEDED
